Please check them out. The team over there is great, they put so much time and effort into what they do. Go show them some love, please!  

Dice Cloud is the inpiration behind this project, however being DiceCloud is a Web App it has its limitations and advantages, as does this project. Im producing this App which exsists to fix many of those issues, with the biggest two being speed and offline use.  

## Things To Mention
I should mention, their point was to have a cloud based character manager. However, this project has no cloud access, everthing is stored directly on your computer. They exsist to fix different issues, and though they may share similar aethstetics, I am in no way affiliated with Dice Cloud or their Developement team.  

Backup Files are not compatible between Dice Cloud and this Application or vice versa at thecurrent time.  

## Closings
Please note this is verry much a WIP and a passion project, so yes i know their are bugs they will be adressed eventualy and their may even be times, such as now, that it may be unusable. However i work an 8-5 job and am a solo developer, so please try to be patient, theres only so much one person can do.  

Any questions or issues can be sent to me directly. Prefered contact method through discord at Sage#4244
