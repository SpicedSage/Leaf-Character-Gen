Project based heavily off of DiceCloud.
Their Web App can be found here: https://dicecloud.com
Thier GitHub Repository here:    https://github.com/ThaumRystra/DiceCloud
And thier Patreon here :         https://www.patreon.com/posts/53791769

Please check them out. The team over there is great, they put so much time and effort 
into what they do. Go show them some love, please!

Dice Cloud is the inpiration behind this project, however being DiceCloud is a Web App it
has its limitations and advantages, as does this project. Im producing this App which exsists 
to fix many of those issues, with the biggest two being speed and offline use.

I should mention, their point was to have a cloud based character manager. However, this project 
has no cloud access, everthing is stored directly on your computer. They exsist to fix different 
issues, and though they may share similar aethstetics, I am in no way affiliated with Dice Cloud 
or their Developement team.

Backup Files are not compatible between Dice Cloud and this Application or vice versa at the
current time.

Please note this is verry much a WIP and a passion project, so yes i know their are bugs they 
will be adressed eventualy and their may even be times, such as now, that it may be unusable. 
However i work an 8-5 job and am a solo developer, so please try to be patient, theres only so 
much one person can do.

Any questions or issues can be sent to me directly. Prefered contact method through discord 
at Sage#4244

Thank you for reading through this all, 
here if you got this far, you deserve a cookie, take it, its for you :) üç™ü•õ
